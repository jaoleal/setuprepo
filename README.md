# setuprepo
A repository to save my customization of my setup


## Goal 

three modes for interaction with the system, basic modes:

 * Input
 * control
 * padcontrol

 input mode is the mode that the keyboard is free to interact with the system, but with focus on typing.

 control mode is the mode that the keyboard is restrict to interact with the wm, it means, keys like WASD move the windows without marking with super button

 padcontrol mode is the mode that mine xbox 360 control can interact softly with the system, not moving windows or resizing them for production mode, that is the focus of input and control mode, it means that the point of this control mode is simple, alternate clients, close and opening clients, play and pause videos, and if i have patience, a virtual keyboard that i can type in...

 these modes is beeing developed with chatgpt help, for mine less knowledge of the environment and tool doesnt botter me.
